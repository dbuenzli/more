synopsis: "A minimal toolkit for everyday OCaml programs"
description: """\
More is a toolkit for everyday OCaml programs. It focuses on providing
an ergonomic system library and the minimal tools you end up needing
in most of your programs.

More **is not** an alternative or extended OCaml standard library.
Despite the persistent myths, the OCaml standard library is fine and
improving. More sometimes extends the standard library modules but,
most of the time, only with the aim to test and eventually upstream
the addition.

More is distributed under the ISC license. It depends on the `unix`
library. It optionally depends on the [`cmdliner`] library.
